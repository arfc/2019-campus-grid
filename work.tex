	\begin{itemize}
		\item Finding the optimal size of a reactor to minimize the cost of electricity and steam. \\
                \item The method will use RAVEN (Rabiti, INL), and will be based on a paper 
                        \cite{baker_optimal_2018} that sized a reactor for a 
                        similar grid system.

        F\&S intends to retire the coal boilers by 2030 and replace them with 
        ``Developing Technologies,'' according to the Utilities Master plan 
        \cite{affiliated_engineers_inc_utilities_2015}. Without new 
        technologies available, the current plan is to replace this capacity 
        with  more PPAs and natural gas 
        \cite{affiliated_engineers_inc_utilities_2015}. However, small nuclear 
        power was mentioned as a possible ``developing technology'' which could 
        be considered if ready in time.
