	\begin{itemize}
		\item Finding the optimal size of a reactor to minimize the cost of electricity and steam. \\
		Based on a paper \cite{baker_optimal_2018} that sized a reactor for a similar grid system. 
		\item F \& S will retire the coal boilers by 2025 and replace it with more PPAs and natural gas \cite{affiliated_engineers_inc_utilities_2015} according to the UIUC Energy Master Plan. These decisions were made to minimize the cost of electricity.
